### What are the requirements?

Requirements are important in all projects, but especially development projects. Here are a few questions you will want to ask yourself:

What browsers do I need to support and test for?
What devices do I need to support and test for?
Is the website going to be responsive, or have a separate mobile site?
What stack am I building on? (i.e. WordPress site, Rails app, node.js app, Shopify site, etc.)
